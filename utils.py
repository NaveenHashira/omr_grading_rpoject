def split_boxes(img, num_rows=10, num_cols=5):
    """
    Splits the input image into smaller cells by first dividing it into `num_rows` rows
    and `num_cols` columns per row, then further splitting each cell horizontally into 4 parts.

    This is useful when each grid cell (bubble region) contains multiple smaller bubbles (e.g. Aâ€“D options),
    and we want to isolate each option individually.

    Parameters:
        img (numpy.ndarray): The binary or grayscale image of the answer region.
        num_rows (int): Number of horizontal rows in the answer grid.
        num_cols (int): Number of columns per row (i.e. number of questions per row block).

    Returns:
        list of numpy.ndarray: A flat list of cell images (each representing one option bubble).
                               The total length will be num_rows * num_cols * 4.
